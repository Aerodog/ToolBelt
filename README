The plugin is now available in jar form at:
http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/ToolBelt/

Plugin documentation will be maintained at that page.

This plugin supersedes my previous one named yadp. It provides a wide range of tools for the discerning minecraft player. Ranging from easily duplicating a selected block, to leaping through the air with style.
