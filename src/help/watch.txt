# Here are the configuration descriptions for the watch tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: watch: cooldown: <Number of seconds>
#    This changes how often a user can change the time. This
#    is to prevent someone bugging everyone by constantly
#    cycling the time on the server. This can be overridden
#    by: toolbelt.tool.watch.nowait
# 
# tools: watch: timeDay: <Number for server time>
#    What time should left-clicking with the watch take the
#    server to? Set the world time. Number is an integer
#    between 0 and 24000, inclusive, where 0 is dawn,
#    6000 midday, 12000 dusk and 18000 midnight.
# 
# tools: watch: timeNight: <Number for server time>
#    What time should right-clicking with the watch take the
#    server to? Same guide as timeDay.
