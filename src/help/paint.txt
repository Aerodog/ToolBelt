# Here are the configuration descriptions for the paint tool
# 
# tools: paint: range: <true|false>
#    You can always grab a texture from a distance. Enabling this
#    allows users of the paint brush to also paint a block from a
#    distance. This is significantly more dangerous then grabbing
#    a texture so it only has a range as set in tools.paint.distance.
#    It also has a permission node: toolbelt.tool.paint.range
# 
# tools: paint: distance: <Number of blocks>
#    If you enable painting at range, after a certain distance, it
#    is hard to be accurate. It is suggested to leave the number as
#    is, or experiment to find what feels safe.
# 
# tools: paint: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    If you want to very explicitly limit which blocks can be
#    loaded into the paint brush, and what types of blocks can
#    be overwritten, specify those blocks here. By default this
#    list is empty, which means that all materials not blocked
#    in the next two lists are allowed. NOTE: this list does not
#    overwrite the two block lists below, it simply further
#    restricts the use of the paint brush. Example, onlyAllow: [3,35]
#    blockLoad: [7], blockOverwrite: [7,35] means that the player
#    can load dirt or wool into the paintbrush, but only overwrite
#    dirt blocks. They can't load/overwrite bedrock both because
#    it is not in onlyAllow and because it's block*ed
# 
# tools: paint: blockLoad:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Item IDs set in here will not copy into a users palette. Some
#    of the items can be safely re-enabled (46 is TNT) while
#    others have the possibility of an odd map state (75 is the
#    REDSTONE_TORCH_OFF which is an unnatural state for a Redstone
#    torch that's not being powered). Open an issue on GitHub if
#    enabling any of these breaks the game (or if I missed any).
# 
# tools: paint: blockOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Item IDs set in here will not be overwritten when the user
#    paints. Other then that the message is the same as for
#    the above tools.paint.blockLoad
