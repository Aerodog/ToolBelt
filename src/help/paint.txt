# Here are the configuration descriptions for the paint tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: paint: range: <true|false>
#    You can always grab a texture from a distance. Enabling this
#    allows users of the paint brush to also paint a block from a
#    distance. This is significantly more dangerous then grabbing
#    a texture so it only has a range as set in tools.paint.distance.
#    It also has a permission node: toolbelt.tool.paint.range
# 
# tools: paint: distance: <Number of blocks>
#    If you enable painting at range, after a certain distance, it
#    is hard to be accurate. It is suggested to leave the number as
#    is, or experiment to find what feels safe.
# 
# tools: paint: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    Read the tools.global.onlyAllow help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
# 
# tools: paint: stopCopy:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopCopy help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
# 
# tools: paint: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopOverwrite help in config.yml.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
