# Here are the configuration descriptions for the leap tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: leap: thrust: <Number for height of vertical thrust>
#    This changes how much the user gets pushed when looking
#    nearly straight down. Might be tweaked in the future for
#    broader control.
# 
# tools: leap: cruise: <Number for height to cruise at>
#    When looking nearly directly at the horizon this is what
#    altitude you will approximately fly at.
# 
# tools: leap: teleport: <true|false>
#    This changes the way that a user leaps when they crouch.
#    Instead of a graceful leap, they will instead teleport
#    in the direction they would have leapt. Because this has
#    the possibility to get through obstacles the user should
#    be blocked by, it has a separate permission node:
#    toolbelt.tool.leap.tel
# 
# tools: leap: cFly: <true|false>
#    Bukkit now allows mods to enable players to use creative
#    flight without all of the rest of the creative mode
#    differences. As such left-click with the leap tool can
#    now enable creative flight for a user. The feature can
#    be disabled by setting this to false. Further, if perms
#    are enabled, it can be controlled per user by:
#    toolbelt.tool.leap.fly
# 
# tools: leap: invuln: < -1 | 0 | 1 >
#    This controls what type of fall damage protection the
#    leap tool provides. With a value of -1, all fall damage
#    for players on the server is disabled. With a value of 0
#    no fall damage is prevented at all. With a value of 1,
#    the next instance of fall damage after leaping will be
#    canceled.
# 
# tools: leap: cost: <Number of leaps per (feather)>
#    On a semi-creative mode server, this can be used to limit
#    the number of leaps that can be made with a single item.
#    By default it is set to zero, which means there is no
#    limit. If a positive integer is set, then after leaping
#    that many times, one (item bound to leap tool) will be
#    removed from the users inventory.
