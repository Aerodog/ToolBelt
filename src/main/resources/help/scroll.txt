# Here are the configuration descriptions for the scroll tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file.
# 
# tools: scroll: all: <"no"|"values"|"blocks">
#    *Not recommended to change* (Scroll tool works fine without all:)
#    This allows the administrator to bypass the intelligence of the scroll
#    tool and just mindlessly scroll through all 16 possible values for blocks.
#    "no"     - behave normally, scrolling through meaningful values. (default) 
#    "values" - scroll through all 16 values for all blocks where the data
#               means anything.
#    "blocks" - scroll through all 16 values for all blocks.
