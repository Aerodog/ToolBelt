# Here are the configuration descriptions for the tree tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: tree: possible: [<TreeType strings>, ...]
#    This list controls the tree types that can be created. By default the
#    list is empty, which means there is no restrictions. If any TreeType(s)
#    are listed, then only those listed are allowed. That is to say that
#    possible: is a whitelist as soon as it is not empty.
# 
# A list of all the accepted TreeType values can be found at:
# https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bukkit/TreeType.java
# 
# For example, to only allow the two Mushroom type trees to be created...
#    possible: [RED_MUSHROOM, BROWN_MUSHROOM]
# If you have a long list, it might not fit nicely on one line, in which case use...
#    possible:
#      - BIG_TREE
#      - TALL_REDWOOD
#      - JUNGLE
#      - RED_MUSHROOM
#      - BROWN_MUSHROOM
